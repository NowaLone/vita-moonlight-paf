# Development Roadmap

This roadmap captures the agreed next steps for Vita Moonlight PAF. It is ordered by risk reduction and release readiness, not by a promise that every item must be completed before development continues. Keep individual changes small and verify device-specific behavior on real PS Vita hardware.

## 1. Stabilize the core streaming lifecycle

**Priority: first**

Run the full user journey on a real Vita and record reproducible failures with runtime logs before changing implementation.

- [ ] Discover a PC on the LAN and save/select it.
- [ ] Add a PC manually, including a custom port; verify unsuccessful attempts do not create an incorrect saved-host record.
- [ ] Pair successfully and verify incorrect-PIN errors are distinguished from transport/protocol failures.
- [ ] Retrieve the app list, start a stream, and check video, audio, controller input, and touchscreen input.
- [ ] Stop the stream, return to the app UI, and connect again; check that resources and callbacks are cleaned up safely.
- [ ] Exercise connection failure, host/network loss, recovery, and relevant PS Button/application lifecycle behavior.
- [ ] Verify gyroscope and accelerometer reporting on hardware; the input path exists but is not yet fully hardware-verified.

**Done when:** the main journey and important failure/recovery paths have been exercised on Vita, observed problems are either fixed or documented with reproduction steps, and stream shutdown/reconnect does not leave the app in a broken state.

## 2. Make development builds reproducible

**Priority: next, and can be worked on alongside device validation**

- [ ] Record the exact supported VITASDK revision.
- [ ] Record the exact revisions of `vitasdk-paf-component` and `psp2cxml-tool`.
- [ ] Document dependency setup and environment variables in a clean, repeatable setup procedure.
- [ ] Validate a clean build with `bash build.sh`, including CXML-to-RCO compilation and VPK/SELF generation.
- [ ] Document the expected toolchain and known build warnings; do not treat a build as verified unless it was actually run.

**Done when:** a fresh environment can follow the instructions to build the project without undocumented manual fixes.

## 3. Close technical risks and improve testability

- [ ] Investigate the `[Main] RefreshHosts ... after_insert=` log when reproducing host-list duplication; `after_insert` should equal `hosts`. Determine whether any mismatch comes from persistent records or stale PAF ListView cells before changing code.
- [ ] Identify small, hardware-independent logic suitable for tests, starting with host identity resolution, pairing-result classification, and host persistence decisions.
- [ ] Add focused automated tests for that logic where it can be isolated without mocking the whole PAF runtime.
- [ ] Select and document formatter/static-analysis tooling only if it fits the existing codebase and toolchain.

**Done when:** the known host-list diagnostic has an evidence-based conclusion and the highest-value non-PAF logic has repeatable checks where practical.

## 4. Prepare a release

- [ ] Review licensing and attribution obligations for this project, Moonlight code, and vendored dependencies before choosing or adding a project license.
- [ ] Document installation, runtime requirements, setup, and known compatibility limitations for the Vita and PC host.
- [ ] Define versioning, release artifact naming, and a release checklist.
- [ ] Perform a final clean build and smoke test on real hardware; verify core streaming and clean shutdown on the release candidate.
- [ ] Publish only artifacts and source revisions that have actually been validated.

**Done when:** licensing/attribution is addressed, users can build or install from documented instructions, and the release candidate has a recorded Vita smoke-test result.

## Working order

Start with **streaming lifecycle validation and motion-input verification**. Work on dependency pinning and reproducible builds in parallel when convenient. Use failures and logs from those runs to prioritize technical fixes; then add focused automated checks and finish with release preparation. Avoid broad speculative refactors or new system integrations until there is a concrete user-facing need.

## Scope boundaries

- Keep PAF UI concerns separate from services, backend, and legacy streaming code.
- Do not change the persistent host/settings formats or locations as incidental cleanup.
- Do not repeat broad native-system API surveys already recorded in `AGENTS.md`; investigate a system API only for a concrete use case.
- Treat hardware observations, build results, and test results as complete only after they have actually been verified.
